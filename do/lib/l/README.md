Stata package lslogit
=====================

*lslogit* is a [Stata](http://www.stata.com/) command that fits mixed logit models with particular focus on the estimation of structural labor supply models. It uses maximum simulated likelihood methods ([Train, 2009](#train_2009)). It makes use of Stata's maximum likelihood framework and is implemented as d2-evaluator ([Gould et al., 2010](#gould_etal_2010)). *lslogit* is written in Mata, Stata's matrix programming language.

I presentend a preview of *lslogit* at the [Stata Conference in New Orleans](http://www.stata.com/meeting/new-orleans13/) in July 2013. You can find the slides of this presentation [here](https://ideas.repec.org/p/boc/norl13/8.html).


## Features
- Flexible utility specifications (translog, quadratic, Box-Cox).
- Observed heterogeneity in preferences as well as alternative specific taste shifters.
- Unobserved preference heterogeneity via multivariate normally distributed random coefficients.
- Integrating out the wage prediction error in order to use of the full wage distribution.
- Automatic calculation of the marginal utility with respect to consumption.
- Allows to impose contraints on the marginal utility of consumption.
- Simultaneous estimation of wages and preferences (work in progress).


## Installation

You can install the latest version of *lslogit* via Stata by typing:
